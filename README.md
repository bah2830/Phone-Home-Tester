# Phone-Home-Tester
Quick docker container for setting up an endpoint for logging web requests for distributed phone home systems.


This container is not meant for any more than just testing and the data is not persistent.


### What Is This For?
when testing a large cluster or distributed system it is often required to automate a process and a quick way to test that is have them all phone home with some information about themselves. This can be useful to make sure they all respond and how fast and consistently they respond.
